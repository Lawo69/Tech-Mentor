            <h1>Applied Learning Project</h1>
            <p> &emsp; Centered around projects, this Specialization will help you create a portfolio of work to demonstrate your new programming 
                skills. In the capstone you will create a recommender engine similar to those used by Netflix or Amazon. Additional projects in 
                your portfolio will include:an interactive webpage that applies filters to images, an analysis of CSV data files, an encryption 
                program, and a predictive text generator.</p>

            <h1>Take Courses</h1>
            <p> &emsp;A Tech Mentor Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, 
                or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, 
                you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or 
                end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.</p>

        <div class="info">
            <h1>Hands-on Project</h1>
            <p> &emsp;Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization 
                and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each of 
                the other courses before you can start it.</p>
