            <h1>About this Specialization</h1>
            <p> &emsp; Learn front-end and hybrid mobile development, with server-side support, for implementing a multi-platform solution.
                The first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: Bootstrap 4 and React. On the server side, you’ll 
                learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment and Express framework, and communicate to 
                the client side through a RESTful API. Learners enrolling in this Specialization are expected to have prior working knowledge 
                of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br/><br> &emsp;Ideally learners should complete the courses in the specified sequence. </p>

            <h1>Applied Learning Project</h1>
            <p> &emsp; Learners will work on hands-on exercises, culminating in development of a full-fledged application at the end of each 
                course. Each course also includes a mini-Capstone Project as part of the Honors Track where you’ll apply your skills to build 
                a fully functional project.</p>

            <h1>Take Courses</h1>
            <p> &emsp;A Tech Mentor Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization 
                directly, or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of 
                a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you 
                can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments 
                and your progress.</p>

        <div class="info">
            <h1>Hands-on Project</h1>
            <p> &emsp;Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the 
                Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll 
                need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.</p>
