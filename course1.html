            <h1>About this Spacialization</h1>
            <p> &emsp; The UI/UX Design Specialization brings a design-centric approach to user interface and user experience design, and offers practical, 
                skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or programming 
                alone. In this sequence of four courses, you will summarize and demonstrate all stages of the UI/UX development process, from user 
                research to defining a project’s strategy, scope, and information architecture, to developing sitemaps and wireframes. You’ll learn 
                current best practices and conventions in UX design and apply them to create effective and compelling screen-based experiences for 
                websites or apps.<br/><br/>
                &emsp; User interface and user experience design is a high-demand field, but the skills and knowledge you will learn in this Specialization 
                are applicable to a wide variety of careers, from marketing to web design to human-computer interaction. <br/><br/>
                &emsp; Learners enrolled in the UI/UX Design Specialization are eligible for an extended free trial (1 month) of a full product suite of UX 
                tools from Optimal Workshop. Details are available in Course 3 of the Specialization, Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture.

            <h1>Applied Learning Project</h1>
            <p>&emsp; In this Specialization you will participate in several short exercises—both visual and non-visual—to apply acquired knowledge, from organizing 
                and structuring screen-based content, defining goals and strategy, to creating wireframes and visual mockups. By the end of this Specialization, 
                you will have produced a mid-level digital prototype with simulated functionality, as well as a comprehensive plan for a complex website.

            <h1>Take Courses</h1>
            <p>&emsp; A Tech Mentor Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, or review its 
                courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed 
                to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner 
                dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.

        <div class="info">
            <h1>Hands-on Project</h1>
            <p>&emsp; Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your 
                certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.

        <div class="info">
            <h1>Earn a Certificate</h1>
            <p>&emsp; When you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you'll earn a Certificate that you can share with prospective employers and your professional network.
