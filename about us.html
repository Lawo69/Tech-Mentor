            <h1>We believe</h1>
            <p>Learning is the source of human progress.<br/><br/>
                It has the power to transform our world<br/>
                from illness to health,<br/>
                from poverty to prosperity,<br/>
                from conflict to peace.<br/><br/>
                It has the power to transform our lives<br/>
                for ourselves,<br/>
                for our families,<br/>
                for our communities.<br/><br/>
                No matter who we are or where we are,<br/>
                learning empowers us to change and grow<br/>
                and redefine what’s possible.<br/>
                That’s why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege<br/><br/>
                And that’s why Coursera is here.<br/>
                We partner with the best institutions<br/>
                to bring the best learning<br/>
                to every corner of the world.<br/><br/>
                So that anyone, anywhere has the power to<br/>
                transform their life through learning.</p>

            <h1>Our story</h1>
            <p>Tech Mentor was founded by Supun Gunawardana in 2012 with a vision of providing life-transforming learning experiences to learners around the world. Today, Coursera is a global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies. Coursera received B Corp certification in February 2021, which means that we have a legal duty not only to our shareholders, but to also make a positive impact on society more broadly, as we continue our efforts to reduce barriers to world-class education for all.</p>
